# FordGo-Bike-System-Data-Exploration-and-Visualization.
## by Edem Doe Honu

## Dataset

> The Ford GoBike System dataset provides detailed information/data on the greater San Francisco Bay in regard to individual bike usage/ride in a bike sharing system. Some data variables used essentially for the exploration exercise included: duration_sec, bike_id, member_birth_year, user_type, member_birth_year, member_gender,end_station_name, bike_share_for_all_trip, start_time, end_time and age_bikers.

> Data wrangling was performed on the dataset to prepare the dataset accurately for analysis and exploration and this process basically included:

> Data Gathering: Gathered the data fordgobike-tripdata in csv format which was provided in Udacity workspace.

> 1.Data Assessing: Visually and programmatically explored the dataset to detect quality/tidiness issues with the dataset that might negatively impact the data analysis process.

> 2.Data Cleaning: Revamped dataset to improve its quality and viability for effective analysis and visualization. Cleaning included:
 
 >1. Dropping redundant columns.
 >2. Converting date/time fields to Datetime time stamp.
 >3. Filling missing data in member_gender and member_birth_year columns.


## Summary of Findings

 >1. Most users of the bike system were males, subsribers, and did not also enroll into the Bike Share For All program.
 
 >2. Users of age 37 patronized the bike service the most.
 
 >3. The highest average trip duration across all users were less than an hour.
 
 >4. Other gender types users, customer users and users age 21 made longer trips.
 
 >5. There is a poor correlation between variables in the dataset which makes it impossible to make significant extensive analysis.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For my explanatory analysis, my main focus is to present the impact age of bikers have on the trend of the trip duration among users types.

>Specifically, I will explore the trend of the trip duration across the user ages by the user type(customer, subscriber), gender type(male, female and other genders) and, the bike for all user membership. 

> In my presentation, I will initially explain the trend/distribution of trip duration according to their frequencies.

> I will then show the correlation between the main features and trip duration and how the correlation can impact trip duration or even help predict trip duration for a particular user type.
